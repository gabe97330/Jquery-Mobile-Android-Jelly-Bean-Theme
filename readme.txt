ANDROID JELLY BEAN THEME FOR JQUERY MOBILE 1.0
By Johan Kivi.

To be frank, I am a apple fanboy. I never owned a android device, hell Ive bearly touched one! But since the introduction of Sandwich Icecream (4.0) I really like the new design. I have started to experiment with the amazing Jquery mobile framework and wanted to create some nice looking Android themed apps, so here it is.

I am a fair frontend designer, not a great one. So this theme is not proper coded. My priority have been to stay true to the android design guidelines, not all the functionality of a JQM theme. Therefore you need to have a good look at the code of this file since Ive made a few custom css-classes.

As you may have noticed by now, this theme is the Holo Light version. The Holo Dark version will be produced when Holo Light version is complete!

You may alter, extend, share and do what ever you like with this theme.

Have a nice day!
